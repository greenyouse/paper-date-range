paper-date-range
=================

Calendar for selecting a range of dates. It varies slightly from normal
Material Design but it's pretty close.

This is designed to be a fully accessible calendar that gets as close to 
[WCAG 2 .0 AAA conformance](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#conformance) as
possible. This means things like keyboard navigation, high color
contrast, WAI-ARIA, and others should be used. If you have suggestions
for accessibility improvements, please file an issue.
